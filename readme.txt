== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= what feeds do you carry and can I see a preview ? =
While we have many public statistics on various websites, the easiest way to see some of our datafeed power is probably to visit:
http://feed-monster.com for networks like clixgalore,cj,shareasale etc. or
http://feed-monster.nl for networks like tradetracker,daisycon,m4n etc.

= can I really make money with this ? =
judge for yourself: http://portaljumper.com/597/seeing-is-believing-but-no-one-seems-to-understand/

= I represent an affiliate network. Can you add our network ? =
We do get a good amount of requests from smaller networks that want to be included in feed monster. We do hold strict standards when it comes to allowing networks in. Please contact us to discuss your options. Make sure that at minimum: 
-You provide free access to your services for our users, 
-You sanitize & check your datafeeds to assure a minimum operational use (We will sanitize/convert your feeds to production level), 
-You allow global users into your system.

= I this really free and is it going to stay free ? =
yes, and yes. Although you can always upgrade to premium mode for enhanced features, the freebie version is fully functional without limitations.

= I have a feature request, can you add it ? =
We can sure look at it and see if we can implement it. Our systems are built for you and based upon opinions from users like you. Simply drop a post at http://portaljumper.com/forums and we'll keep in touch !

= I am a merchant ! Why is my feed not on feed-monster ? =
There could be various reasons. Sometimes your feed contains harmful or broken items so we freeze your feed to protect our users. Contact us and we'll work with you to get your feed (back) into the system.

= I am a merchant ! We are not affiliated with a major network. Can you add our feeds ? =
Contact us and we'll review your options to get your feed into the system.

= How do I install curl ? =
You shouldn't have to. 99.97% of all hosting platforms has curl installed. If you are handy enough to install it yourself you shouldn't have to ask this question. If you are on shared hosting there is nothing you can do yourself to activate cURL. Contact your host and ask them to activate it with PHP !
